# Why Rails?

# Ancestry

![bg contain right](./assets/evolution.png)

- Did you know the DNA of humans and chimpanzees is ~98% the same?
<!-- Most of our DNA is the plumbing of being alive, being primates, etc. -->
- Only a *tiny* bit makes us distinct from chimpanzees.
- We have exactly the same 98% since we descended from a common ancestor, approximately 6-10 million years ago.

---
# Ancestry

- Similarly, **Twitter** and **Airbnb** share 98% of their code.
- Most SaaS applications have same core code:
    - web server
    - connecting to the database
    - rendering html
    - etc.
- Only a <small>tiny</small> bit makes them distinct
<!-- tweets instead of listings, etc. -->
- **Twitter** and **Airbnb** have exactly the same core code, since they share a common ancestor.

# History
- In 2003, a Chicago entrepreneur (Jason Fried) hired a Danish programmer (David Heinemeier Hansson) to build an idea he had for project management SaaS: **Basecamp**.
- David loved an obscure programming language called **Ruby**, which was invented in Japan in the mid 1990’s. Ruby was slow, but expressive and “beautiful” (to David). Jason didn’t really care what David used, so 👍

---
# History
- Once he got Basecamp working, David extracted the 98% of it that was common plumbing for all SaaS and released it for free, open-source.
- He called this package of Ruby code that let you quickly get a web application up and running...**Ruby on Rails**.
- It was, at the time, revolutionary.

---
# Our hack

- Much like **Twitter**, **Airbnb**, **NYTimes**, **GitHub**, **Shopify** and thousands of other companies, we’re borrowing David’s (and, by now, thousands of other contributors’) code.
- This lets us skip re-inventing tens of thousands of lines of code and many years of learning.
- We stand on the shoulders of giants.

# Why Rails?
- Often asked why are we learning Ruby on Rails when there are countless options.
<!-- we haven't even placed anyone in a ruby/rails role yet -->

    - Optimize for programmer happiness
    - Convention over configuration
    - Integrated systems (full-stack)
    - and more!

---

# Play the whole game
- The crucial piece in finally making programming “click” is learning all the skills needed to deploy an application, not just one or two pieces.
  - I.e., we become full-stack developers.
- Most courses or books teach you one language or skill, but then you’re left wondering how that fits in with the 99 other things you need to know in order to deploy an application.
- Making a real, functional application is motivating! It gives you a reason to continue learning — to improve it, and to make the next one.

---
# Play the whole game

- Majestic monoliths!
    - A whole system that addresses an entire problem.
- This means Rails is concerned with everything from the front-end JavaScript needed to make live updates to how the database is migrated from one version to another in production.

---

# Convention over configuration

- Decrease the number of decisions that a developer is required to make without losing flexibility
- As a beginner, this frees up mental "RAM" to focus on solving a problem.

---
# Convention over configuration

<!-- foreign key example -->
- We just learned about database "primary keys"
- Does it matter the format your database primary keys are described by?
- Does it really matter whether it’s “id”, “postId”, “posts_id”, or “pid”?
- As long as we agree to consistently use 1 format, this is not a decision that’s worthy of recurrent deliberation.

--- 

# Convention over configuration
<!-- TODO: routing example -->
- We just learned about routing in rails
- If you follow the rails "naming convention", you don't need to write as much code

```ruby
class PagesController
  def home
    # not needed, it automagically looks for this file in `views/pages/home`
    # based on controller (pages) and action (home) name
    render({ :template => "pages/home" })
  end
end
```

# Programmer Happiness

## The Principle of Least Surprise
```
$ irb
irb(main):001:0> exit
$ irb
irb(main):001:0> quit

$ python
>>> exit
Use exit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit
```

- Ruby accepts both exit and quit
<!-- to accommodate the programmer’s obvious desire to quit its interactive console. -->
- Python pedantically instructs the programmer how to properly do what’s requested
<!-- even though it obviously knows what is meant since it’s displaying the error message -->

# Rails Doctrine
- Many of the reasons are outlined in the "controversial" [Rails doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)

- https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine
